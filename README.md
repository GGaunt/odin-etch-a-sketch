Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of sqaure divs DONE
Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line) - Do not use CSS Grid as this will be taught later, DONE
Be care with borders and margins as they can adjust the size of the sqaures, DONE
Set up a "hover" effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them leaving a pixelated trail through your grid, DONE
Add a button on top of screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid - Once entered the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you've got a new sketch pad, DONE
Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100, DONE
You should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used, DONE

EXTRA CREDIT 

Rather than sqaures being made the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squares' RGB values with each interaction, 

Additionally implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%,
